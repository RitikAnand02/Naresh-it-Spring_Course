Q1: 
Wish Message Generator Using Constructor Injection in Spring
You are tasked with developing a Spring Core application that generates a wish message based on the current time of day using constructor-based dependency injection. The application should use LocalDateTime to determine whether to send a "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon", or "Good Evening" message.

Requirements:
WishMessageGenerator Class:

Create a WishMessageGenerator class with the following attributes:
LocalDateTime currentDateTime: This will store the current date and time.
Implement a constructor WishMessageGenerator(LocalDateTime currentDateTime) to allow for dependency injection using Spring.
Implement a generateWishMessage() method that returns:
"Good Morning" if the time is before 12 PM.
"Good Afternoon" if the time is between 12 PM and 6 PM.
"Good Evening" if the time is after 6 PM.
Note:
Use an XML file to configure the Spring bean.
Main Class:
Create a main class that loads the Spring application context, retrieves the WishMessageGenerator bean, and prints the wish message based on the current time.
Expected Output:

If the current time is before 12 PM:
Good Morning  
If the current time is between 12 PM and 6 PM:
Good Afternoon  
If the current time is after 6 PM:
Good Evening 

Q3: 
Date Printer Using Constructor Injection in Spring
You are tasked with developing a Spring Core application that prints the current date using constructor-based dependency injection. The application will make use of LocalDate (a predefined class in Java) to demonstrate the constructor injection of a LocalDate object.
Requirements:
DatePrinter Class:
Create a DatePrinter class with the following attributes:
LocalDate currentDate: This will store the current date.
Implement a constructor DatePrinter(LocalDate currentDate) to allow for dependency injection using Spring.
Implement a printDate() method that prints the current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

Note:
Use an XML file to configure the Spring bean.
Main Class:
Create a main class that loads the Spring application context, retrieves the DatePrinter bean, and calls printDate(). 

Discount Calculator Using Constructor Injection in Spring
You are tasked with developing a Spring Core application that calculates discounts based on a product's price and the day of the week using constructor-based dependency injection. The discount rate will change based on whether it's a weekday or weekend.

Requirements:
DiscountCalculator Class:

Create a DiscountCalculator class with the following attributes:
LocalDate currentDate: This will store the current date.
double price: This will store the product price.
Implement a constructor DiscountCalculator(LocalDate currentDate, double price) to allow for dependency injection using Spring.
Implement a calculateDiscount() method that returns:
A 10% discount if the day is a weekday (Monday to Friday).
A 20% discount if the day is a weekend (Saturday or Sunday).
Note:
Use an XML file to configure the Spring bean.
Main Class:
Create a main class that loads the Spring application context, retrieves the DiscountCalculator bean, and prints the discounted price based on the day of the week.
Expected Output:

If the current day is a weekday (e.g., Tuesday) and the price is 100:
Discounted Price: 90.0 (10% discount applied)  
If the current day is a weekend (e.g., Saturday) and the price is 100:
Discounted Price: 80.0 (20% discount applied)
